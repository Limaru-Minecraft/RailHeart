# RailHeart

RailHeart: The premier railway signalling plugin for TrainCarts.

RailHeart is a modular plugin designed to make your TrainCarts railroading experience as smooth as possible. It will contain everything a railroader needs: signals, announcements, you name it, we have it!

## Contributing

RailHeart is designed to be modular - you don't need to download the entire plugin if you don't need all the features! Each module comes with its own README that tells you what that module does.
